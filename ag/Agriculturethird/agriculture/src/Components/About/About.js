We’ve been covering PC gaming for more than 20 years, and continue that legacy today with worldwide print editions and around-the-clock news, features, esports coverage, hardware testing and game reviews on PCGamer.com, as well as major yearly events including the PC Gaming Show at E3. Beyond the packed stadiums, flashy buzzwords and million-dollar prizes, lies the real soul of esports. It’s the discipline to train non-stop and develop the strategy and skills to bend your opponent to your will. It’s the camaraderie and bonds made between teammates, fans and countrymen as you experience painful losses and the euphoria of victory. And most of all, it’s the never-ending drive and passion to keep competing—and win.</span></p>
